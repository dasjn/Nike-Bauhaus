# Nike x The Bauhaus

The challenge was to create a Nike Bauhaus Edition website that honors the Bauhaus art movement while showcasing the fusion of art and functionality in the Nike Air Max 270 React shoes.

This project is, in essence, a way to pay homage to a design movement that is still relevant almost 100 years later. It's a way of expressing gratitude to the great individuals who collaborated to shape this way of thinking. It's also a note of thanks to the designers and professionals at Nike who worked to create a product that is both bold and respectful of The Bauhaus.
